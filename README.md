# hashcalc
Personal project to make a hash verifier in Python. 
****HASHCALC by SETH ALPHA v 0.1****
to run the md5 of a single selected file use the SingleFileMD5Calc.py 
it will ask for a file to be selected and will return the MD5 and will then save this to a file as displayed

to run md5s of multiple files use the MultiFileMD5Calc.py 
This will save a file with all of the MD5s of each selected file

***CURRENTLY the MD5compare.py does not work. It needs to ask the user to select 2 previous MD5 saves from
the above to tools and will then show any changes. If no changes, it will say, "no chanes"
